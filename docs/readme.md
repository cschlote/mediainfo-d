This directory contains the original header files for libmediainfo, which were
used to create the D bindings.

This is the lowlevel C interface and some some simple class wrapper:
- MediaInfoDLL/MediaInfoDLL.h

Some C++ classes:
- MediaInfo/MediaInfoDLL.h
- MediaInfo/MediaInfo_Events.h
- MediaInfo/MediaInfo.h
- MediaInfo/MediaInfoList.h

The files are part of the libmediainfo-dev package on Debian/Ubuntu

All header files are copyrighted by MediaArea.net SARL. All Rights Reserved.
They included unmodified as a reference. Diff against future versions
might help to update the bindings eventually.
